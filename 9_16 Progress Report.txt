Subsystem 1 - Julia (9/16)
* As a team we decided on the microcontroller and sensor we are using
   * Sensor: THERMAL IMAGE SENSOR 160HX120V
   * Microcontroller: ESP32
* Researched the viability of fiber optic cables to transfer data, not viable
* Researched how to encase the sensor and accompanying pcb, so the switchgear can pass the dielectric test. 
   * A thin plastic material should work as it won’t interfere with the thermal sensor and isn’t metal
* Requested Altium access -> gained Altium access
* Created the github repository
* Researched possible power supplies, need at least 3.1 volts to power chosen sensor
   * GB20S05K01 - AC/DC CONVERTER 5V 15W ($8)
   * IRM-15-5 - Enclosed AC DC Converters 1 Output 5V 3A 85 ~ 305 VAC, 120 ~ 430 VDC Input ($9.28)
   * PAAM15-10 - Enclosed AC DC Converters 1 Output 5V 3A 90 ~ 264 VAC, 120 ~ 370 VDC Input ($20.59)
   * All three meet voltage requirements, PAAM has the best temperature rating with a max operating temp of 80 C, the other two have a max of 70 C.
      * Over double the price might not be worth only a 10 degree increase
* Researched how to plot a heatmap on matlab

This week
* Order parts so testing can begin (monday)
* Set up Altium and start the subsystem project, goal is to finish

Subsystem 2-Blake (9/16)
* Mainly have been reading the FLIR sensor's engineering document
* Looking at things such as coniguration, environmental conditions, and how the sensor filters noise
* Researching the sensor's serial interface (SPI)
* Looking at ESP32's that we would possibly use (How much memory?)
* Looking into ML of images to automatically tell if switch is open or closed
* Ordering an ESP32 dev kit to start on intro project



Subsystem 3-Erica (9/16)
Started Researching website developments and built basic html layout that shows the video streaming feed
It currently displays an empty video and drop down to view different switchgear #’s
Researching API for fetching videos
Brainstorming new website features to be implemented:
Next steps:
Make it look nice, put in powell colors/font
Have login screen to input employee ID (requires database)
Have search for switchgear serial code, once it pulls up it will display adjacent switchgears in drop down format (so operator does not have to retype code for switchgear right next to the original one)
