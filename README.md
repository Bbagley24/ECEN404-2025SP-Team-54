## Overview

As industry demand grows, space inside medium voltage switchgear has become increasingly limited. Manufacturers are required to fit more devices and wires within the same limited space. Additionally, manufacturers are now being asked to include a remote viewing system within the switchgear to monitor a physical ground switch. This ground switch is physically blocked, by wires, from the view of the operator.

Our solution to this problem is to create a thermal remote viewing system that an operator can connect to through Wi-Fi, allowing for operators to confirm the grounding switch is either open or closed through video and automation. This will make switchgear operators jobs safer and more convenient.
